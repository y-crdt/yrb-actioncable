# yrb-actioncable

> An ActionCable companion for Y.js clients

This is a monorepo with [npm modules](./packages) and [Ruby gems](./gems).
Please check the respective sub-repos for more information. 

## Usage

Install gem and npm package:

```
gem install y-rb_actioncable
yarn add @y-rb/actioncable
```

### Example

Create a Rails channel that includes the Sync module:

```ruby
# app/channels/sync_channel.rb
class SyncChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  include Y::Actioncable::Sync

  def subscribed
    # initiate sync & subscribe to updates, with optional persistence mechanism
    sync_for(session)
  end

  def receive(message)
    # broadcast update to all connected clients on all servers
    sync_to(session, message)
  end
end
```

Create a client and bind to an instance of the [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/)
editor:

```typescript
import {WebsocketProvider} from "@y-rb/actioncable";
import { createConsumer } from "@rails/actioncable";

const document = new Y.Doc();
const consumer = createConsumer();

const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
  document,
  consumer,
  "SyncChannel",
  {id: "1"}
);

new Editor({
  element: document.querySelector("#editor"),
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({history: false}),
    Collaboration.configure({document}),
    CollaborationCursor.configure({
      provider,
      user: {name: "Hannes", color: "#ff0000"}
    })
  ]
});
```

## Development

Make sure you have Ruby and Node.js w/ yarn installed. We recommend to manage
runtimes with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

`yrb-actioncable` is a mix of Ruby and JavaScript repositories. The JavaScript
repositories are manged with [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo).
After you have successfully run `yarn` in the repository root, _turbo_ will be
available and can be used to build packages.

### JavaScript

```bash
yarn
yarn lint:fix     # lint and autocorrect violations
yarn turbo build  # build npm package
```

Releasing a new version of an npm module is easy. We use
[changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md)
to make it really simple:

```bash
# Add a new changeset
changeset

# Create new versions of packages
changeset version

# Commit and push to main
# GitHub Action will automatically create a tag, a GitHub release entry, build
# and publish the package to npmjs.com. The GitHub Action runs`yarn release`.
```

If you need to create a new package, please use [tsdx](https://tsdx.io/) for
setup. It removes a lot of the setup pain, and creates correct builds for
many targets (Node.js, ECMAScript Modules, AMD, â€¦).

### Ruby

Ruby development is less automated. You **cannot** use `turbo` commands to build
the `gem`, isntead you need to manually build and release Ruby gems. All gems
in the `./gems` directory where created using the standard method described on
[rubygems.org](https://guides.rubygems.org/make-your-own-gem/).

```
cd gems/yrb-actioncable
bundle
rake spec
rake build                                    # y-rb_actioncable 0.1.5 built to pkg/y-rb_actioncable-0.1.5.gem
cd pkg && gem push y-rb_actioncable-0.1.5.gem # release new version on rubygems.org
```

The documentation for a gem is automatically generated and published every time
a PR gets merged into `main`. You can find the documentation here:
https://y-crdt.github.io/yrb-actioncable/

The [sandbox environment](./examples/collaborative-text-editor) and running
Redis specific specs in [./gems/yrb-actioncable](./gems/yrb-actioncable) require
Redis. We use Docker to run the Redis server.
